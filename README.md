# LOF_Hybrid_Model
This model provides the Way to combine Local outlier factor algorithm and DBSCAN For Anomaly detection.
Local outleir factor algo is good at detecting local anomalies , whereas DBSCAN is quite good in detecting Global anomalies.Hence our aim is to combine these two.. to get the best output result.
The basic architecture of the model is shown below.
